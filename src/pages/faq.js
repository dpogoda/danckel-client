    <h1 id="howtogoaround">How to go around</h1>

    <p>
      The dorm has four floors and each floor is separated into four sections.
      Each section has a specific color (red, yellow, green, blue). 
      {' '}
      <br />
      <br />
      The elevator is in the red section and from there you can reach any
      section by using your main key. Of course you can also use the stairs :D
      There are two staircases in the building, one beside the entrance and the
      other in the back of the building next to the elevator.
    </p>

    <h1 id="floormoney">Floor money</h1>

    <p>
      Each section has an amount of 30€ per semester. With this money the
      residents of each section can buy what their kitchen needs as soap,
      sponges etc. Or a nice toaster or even arrange a floor breakfast together.
    </p>

    <h4 id="howdoesthiswork">How does this work?</h4>

    <p>
      In order to get your money back you need to bring the receipt to the
      {' '}
      <a href="#howtocontactthesv">SV office hour</a>
      {' '}
signed by three residents
      of your section including yourself. Remember the whole amount permitted
      per semester cannot exceed 30€.
      <br />
      Remember to use the 30€ by the end of the semester (end of March and end
      of September).
    </p>

      The gym is located next to the SV office on the right hand side of the

    <p>
      The washing machines and the dryer are located in the basement and you can

      <br />
      <br />
      There are five washing machines and one dryer. The cost per wash is 2€ and
      per drying cycle is 1€. The payment is done by your charged washing card

    <h1 id="foodsharing">Food sharing</h1>

    <p>
      <a href="https://foodsharing.de/">Food sharing</a>
      {' '}
is an amazing platform.
      After signing up you can get food from restaurants or super markets which
      would have normally been thrown away which in most cases is a waste.
    </p>

    <h1 id="kitchen">Kitchen</h1>

    <p>
      Each floor has another kitchen culture. Please ask you neighbors which
      dishes you can use etc.

      Please also keep in mind to keep the surfaces in the kitchen clean and
      wash your dishes
    </p>

    <h1 id="garbage">Garbage</h1>

    <p>
      Every day in the morning (mo-fr) a cleaning company collects the garbage
      from each kitchen and bathroom. Please keep in mind that they do not
      collect private garbage. This you have to take yourself to the containers
      located in the inner court. There you can find different containers.

    <h1 id="tutor">Tutor</h1>

    <p>
      Beside the SV the dorm has also a tutor. While the SV has more
      administrative tasks the tutor is the first contact person when you have
      problems or questions (e.g. concerning visa, the dorm life etc.). 
      {' '}
      <br />
      You can contact him or her by calling 0151 16 60 02 77

    <h1 id="transportation">Transportation</h1>

      <li>Bus M45</li>

      <li>S41 and S42</li>

      <li>U2</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="ourcaretakerhausmeister">Our caretaker - Hausmeister</h1>

    <p>
      Probably you've already met the Hausmeister. Mr. Hielscher is there for
      you if you have problems with things like repairing your sink, getting new
      lights etc. The Hausmeister office is located on the righthand side after
      entering the main entrance.
    </p>

    <h1 id="studentselfadministrationstudentischeselbstverwaltung">
      Student self-administration/ 'Studentische Selbstverwaltung'
    </h1>

    <p>
      Many different matters which are taken care of behind the scences, which
      are organized and taken care of on a voluntary basis by students who are
      living here as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      The so called 'SV' (Studentische Selbstverwaltung) undertakes many
      different tasks. We organize events, mediate between residents whenever
      conflict arise, communicate with representatives of the
      'Studierendenwerk', administer the SV's finance, provide group facilites
      like the common room, the bar and the lavatory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each year we hold a general meeting with the dorm's residents to elect the
      new board for the SV team. This is when we present our past work and the
      responsibilites and rights of every post to the audience.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        Please come and vote, even if you are not keen to run for a post
      </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Without a minimum attendance there will be no election outcome and no new
      SV-board which means that we will have to shut down the lavatory, the
      common room and the bar.
    </p>

    <h2 id="howtocontactthesv">How to contact the SV?</h2>

    <p>
      We have two office hours. Monday 8-9pm, Wednesday 9-10pm. You can send us
      also an email to svdanckelmannev@gmail.com

    <h2 id="insurances">Insurances</h2>

    <p>
      Is this your first appartment in Germany? Then you have probably never
      taken out any insurance in Germany as well. Generally it is recommended to
      get a household and idemnity insurance. These two are often sold as a
      combined package. We advise you to compare different offers and choose the
      one which best suits your needs. 
      {' '}
      <br />
      We advise yo to ensure that you have health insurance, please contact your
      insurance company if you have any concerns.
    </p>

    <h2 id="yournewaddress">Your new address</h2>

    <p>
      Institutions like banks, insurance companies and the university need to
      know your current address. You have to inform them about your change of
      address, normally there are special forms for this procedure. Because mail
      often gets mixed up here it is highly recommended to communicate your WEN
      (apartment number) as well. You can easily find this number just above
      your apartment door or in your rental contract (the last three digits are
      sufficient!).
