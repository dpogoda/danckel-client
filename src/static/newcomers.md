# Welcome

Welcome to our dorm!  
This page gives a little introduction into our dorm.  
Feel free to use the [feedback function](http://localhost:8000/feedback) if you have any questions or suggestions.  
Thanks to Daniel, Ina, Miranda and Shaimaa for help!

# We are here for you

If you experience any problem in the dormitory or if you have any complain, please contact the SV or the tutor for assistance and guidance.  
To reach the SV you can either write an e-mail to svdanckelmannev@gmail.com or you can come directly to one of our [office hours](). They take place twice a week, currently on Monday (9-10pm) and Wednesday (8-9pm).

# How to go around

The dorm has four floors and each floor is separated into four sections. Each section has a specific color (red, yellow, green, blue).  
FOTO COLOR  
The elevator is in the red section and from there you can reach any section by using your main key. Of course you can also use the stairs :D There are two staircases in the building, one beside the entrance and the other in the back of the building next to the elevator.

# Floor money

Each section has an amount of 30€ per semester. With this money the residents of each section can buy what their kitchen needs as soap, sponges etc. Or a nice toaster or even arrange a floor breakfast together.

#### How does this work?

In order to get your money back you need to bring the receipt to the [SV office hour]() signed by three residents of your section including yourself. Remember the whole amount permitted per semester cannot exceed 30€.  
Remember to use the 30€ by the end of the semester (end of March and end of September).

# SV Office Hour - When is it again?

We're there for you twice a week, Monday (9-10pm) and Wednesday (8-9pm) in the SV room. Our room is located on the right side after entering the building from the main entrance.

#### What can you expect in the SV office hours?

* Charge your [washing card]()
* Ask for assistance or find a solution for a problem you're facing
* Get the gym keys
* Borrow a vacuum cleaner
* Borrow a tool box
* Borrow boarding games, pool and table tennis equipments etc.

# Do you have a vacuum cleaner?

You can borrow the following things in the [SV office hours]():

* Vacuum cleaner - yes you need to keep it clean there!
* Tool box - After visiting IKEA you may need it...
* Boarding games - Are you bored ?
* Pool and table tennis equipments - Ein bisschen Bewegung kann nicht schaden ([google translator]())
* Gym keys - yes, we have a gym!
* etc.

# Gym - Or at least this is how we call it...

Do you feel like having those six packs but it is too cold outside to go to the gym? Do you want to go for a run but you just ordered pizza? Don't worry.  
 The gym is located next to the SV office on the right hand side of the main entrance. You need a special key to enter it which you can get in the [SV office hour]() for a deposit of 50€ that you get back once you bring back the key. The gym can be used 24/7.

# Bar

Do you want to enjoy a beer with your mates after a hard week at the uni ? Then the bar is the right place for you!  
We have a bar on the ground floor. Everytime the bar will be opened, it will be announced in the dormitory WhatsApp group. Keep tuned!

#### Can I open the bar by myself?

Yes. Just come to the [SV office hour]() and we will give you instructions on how to use the bar. There are some limitations when using it:

* When the bar is open everyone should able to access it. So complete private parties are not allowed since no one should feel excluded
* There is a volume limit for the music since the bar is not well isolated and we want to respect the sleep of our neighbors
* It is not allowed to be loud in the inner courts and in front of the house. Especially after 10 pm.

# Common room

The common room is located on the ground floor and is accessible to everyone. There you find the pool, the tennis table and the foosball table.  
Please take care of the things inside the room and also of the noise since this room is not well isolated.

# Washing machines - Time to wash?

The washing machines and the dryer are located in the basement and you can access it through the inner court (see map).  
FOTO  
There are five washing machines and one dryer. The cost per wash is 2€ and per drying cycle is 1€. The payment is done by your charged washing card (you can charge it in the [SV office hours]()).

#### But how do I get a washing card?

For a deposit of 10€ you will get a washing card that you can charge at the [SV office hours]() and use it to turn on the washing machines and dryer.

# Food sharing

[Food sharing](https://foodsharing.de/) is an amazing platform. After signing up you can get food from restaurants or super markets which would have normally been thrown away which in most cases is a waste.

# Kitchen

Each floor has another kitchen culture. Please ask you neighbors which dishes you can use etc.  
Please also keep in mind to keep the surfaces in the kitchen clean and wash your dishes

# Garbage

Every day in the morning (mo-fr) a cleaning company collects the garbage from each kitchen and bathroom. Please keep in mind that they do not collect private garbage. This you have to take yourself to the containers located in the inner court. There you can find different containers.

#### Where to throw what?

Each container is dedicated to a type of garbage:

# Tutor

Beside the SV the dorm has also a tutor. While the SV has more administrative tasks the tutor is the first contact person when you have problems or questions (e.g. concerning visa, the dorm life etc.).  
You can contact him or her by calling TELEFONNUMMER

# Transportation

Our dorm is well connected to all kind of public transportation:

* Bus M45
* S41 and S42
* U2

See the [Map]() section for more details.

# Our caretaker - Hausmeister

Probably you've already met the Hausmeister. Mr. Hielscher is there for you if you have problems with things like repairing your sink, getting new lights etc. The Hausmeister office is located on the righthand side after entering the main entrance.

# TV and Internet

You already have a cable port in your room but you need to get your own Internet. You can also ask one of your neighbors whether they want to share their Internet with you. However, an Internet connection is planned for the entire dormitory by the Studierendenwerk in 2019.

# Student self-administration/ 'Studentische Selbstverwaltung'

Many different matters which are taken care of behind the scences, which are organized and taken care of on a voluntary basis by students who are living here as well.

The so called 'SV' (Studentische Selbstverwaltung) undertakes many different tasks. We organize events, mediate between residents whenever conflict arise, communicate with representatives of the 'Studierendenwerk', administer the SV's finance, provide group facilites like the common room, the bar and the lavatory.

Each year we hold a general meeting with the dorm's residents to elect the new board for the SV team. THis is wwhen we present our past work and the responsibilites and rights of every post to the audience.

**Please come and vote, even if you are not keen to run for a post**

Without a minimum attendance there will be no election outcome and no new SV-board which means that we will have to shut down the lavatory, the common room and the bar.

## How to contact the SV?

We have two office hours

# First steps after moving in

## Registration at the 'Bürgeramt'

Everyone who lives in Germany must be registered at the record section. Within 14 days after moving in you must attend one of Berlin's city halls to register yourself.

There are two exceptions when you do not have to register yourself:

3. Go with all forms and your identity card to a Bürgeramt of your choice and register yourself

You can visit [this site](https://service.berlin.de/dienstleistung/120686/) for more information

## Insurances

Is this your first appartment in Germany? Then you have probably never taken out any insurance in Germany as well. Generally it is recommended to get a household and idemnity insurance. These two are often sold as a combined package. We advise you to compare different offers and choose the one which best suits your needs.  
We advise yo to ensure that you have health insurance, please contact your insurance company if you have any concerns.

## Your new address

Institutions like banks, insurance companies and the university need to know your current address. You have to inform them about your change of address, normally there are special forms for this procedure. Because mail often gets mixed up here it is highly recommended to communicate your WEN (apartment number) as well. You can easily find this number just above your apartment door or in your rental contract (the last three digits are sufficient!).
